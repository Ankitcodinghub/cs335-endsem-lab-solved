Instructions

1. It is an OPEN BOOK and OPEN INTERNET examination.

4. Be sure to follow the upload instructions.

5. Total time for the examination is 2 hours 30 minutes.

6. This is an open-ended assignment. You are free to use any API from the following libraries to solve the problems: pytorch, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, time.

7. Note that you are not supposed to use sklearn

1. Set Retrieval Task In this question we will train a model for set retrieval, i.e. the model ranks the items in a corpus for a given query. To this end, we assume that each query and each corpus is a set of items. For example, a query can be the set of keywords you type in google search bar and corpus is the set of words in the webpage that google returns. Google presents us with a list of corpus in a ranked order. To simplify the problem, we will work with a synthetic dataset where corpus contains a list of 63 webpages. Each webpage can contain different number of words in it. For simplicity, we consider that each query contains a set of exactly 3 keywords in it. Further, we represent words using pre-trained embeddings ‚ààR5. Given a query q, the task is to assign score to the 63 corpus items such that the relevant corpus receive higher scores.

Dataset Description For this problem, we are given with a dataset consisting of the following: ‚Ä¢ List of training queries: We provide 50 training queries in the form of a list. Each query is a set of items of fixed length, where each item is represented by a feature vector in R5 ‚Ä¢ List of corpus: We provide 63 corpus in the form of a list. Each corpus is a set of items of variable length ‚àà [6], where each item is represented by a feature vector in R5 ‚Ä¢ Training ground truth relevance labels: We provide binary relevance labels in the form of a tensor of shape (50,63). The entry (i,j) contains 1 if the jth corpus set is relevant the the ith query set, and 0 otherwise.

‚Ä¢ List of test queries: We provide 10 test queries in the form of a list. Each query is a set of items of fixed length, where each item is represented by a feature vector in R5

Implementation Guidelines You can train any model of your choice. However, you have to adhere to the provided template which requires you to implement the following:

1.a function set_embed in class Model: You can implement any set embedding model that you want, as long as it meets the input and output shape criteria mentioned in the code.

1.b function ranking loss: Implement the following:

X X

ReLU[score(q,c‚úó) ‚àí score(q,c‚úì) + margin]

q‚ààqueries c‚úì‚ààCorpus relevant to q, c‚úó‚ààCorpus irrelevant to q

1.c function mean_average_precision : Implement the mean average precision (mAP) score as described in the following link: [LINK]. You can read till the end of section 2 in the link. You should not use sklearn.

1.d score: Given the query set embedding q ‚ààRd and corpus set embedding c ‚ààRd, compute the following relevance score:

d

score(q,c) = ‚àíXReLU[(q ‚àí c)i]

i=1

Note that you will have to compute the pairwise scores between all available query and corpus embeddings. Make sure to implement a tensorized code.

1.e You will also need to add code for training your models, in the main function.

Evaluation We will be evaluating the following:

1.a /3

1.a correctness of ranking loss

1.b /2

1.b correctness of score

1.c /5

1.c correctness of mean_average_precision

1.d evaluation of test set predictions (with respect to hidden test ground truth): We will only refer to the uploaded output.pkl. We will use the uploaded model files to check the consistency between the predicted scores in output.pkl and the model predictions.

1.d /10

1 Submission instructions

Complete the functions in assignment.py. Do not modify the function signatures. Keep the file in a folder named &lt;ROLL_NUMBER&gt;_exam and compress it to a tar file named

&lt;ROLL_NUMBER&gt;_exam.tar.gz using the command

tar -zcvf &lt;ROLL_NUMBER&gt;_exam.tar.gz &lt;ROLL_NUMBER&gt;_exam

Submit the tar file on Moodle. The directory structure should be ‚Äì

&lt;ROLL_NUMBER&gt;_exam | ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì assignment.py | ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì output.pkl | ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì model.pkl

Replace ROLL_NUMBER with your own roll number. If your Roll number has alphabets, they should be in ‚Äúsmall‚Äù letters.

Total: 20
